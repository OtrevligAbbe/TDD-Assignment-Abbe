# TDD Assignment Abbe 🌟

Welcome to the **TDD Assignment Abbe** repository! This project demonstrates test-driven development (TDD) concepts applied to various programming tasks, including banking, inventory management, string processing, and more. 🚀

## 📂 Project Structure
Here's an overview of the project's structure:
- `BankAccount` 🏦: Simulates a bank account with deposit and withdrawal functionalities.
- `InventoryManager` 📦: Handles inventory management tasks like adding, removing, and tracking items.
- `StringProcessor` 🔤: Performs string-related operations such as sanitization and comparison.
- `BookingSystem` 📅: Manages time slot bookings with overlapping prevention.
- `ObjectValidator` ✅: Validates objects for null values and identifies null properties.

## 🛠️ Features
1. **Bank Account**:
   - Deposit and withdraw amounts.
   - Throws exceptions for invalid operations like overdrawing.
2. **Inventory Management**:
   - Add and remove items with quantity checks.
   - Identify out-of-stock items.
3. **String Processing**:
   - Clean up strings by removing special characters.
   - Compare strings for equality.
4. **Booking System**:
   - Book and retrieve available time slots.
   - Ensure no overlapping bookings.
5. **Object Validation**:
   - Check if an object is null.
   - Retrieve a list of null properties in an object.

## 🧪 Testing
The project uses **xUnit** for testing with a focus on:
- Unit testing 🧩
- Mocking external dependencies 🎭
- Exception handling 🔒
- Edge case coverage 🚧
